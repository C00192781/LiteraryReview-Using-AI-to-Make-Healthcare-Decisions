Topic: Using AI to Make Healthcare Decisions 

Grade: 93.75% 

Abstract: The integration and use of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare decision making is 
drastically changing the healthcare industry. It is improving outcomes for patients, reducing 
costs, helping with staff shortages, and assisting medical practitioners in their work. 

The benefits are demonstrable and numerous. The performance of AI relative to doctors, 
the improvements in diagnosis (particularly in medical imaging), the reduction in medical errors
due to error flagging, the applications in surgery, AIâ€™s ability to assist patients, and the likely 
trajectory of the software are very encouraging. 

However, there are many difficulties and ethical questions raised that are not yet 
answered for. There is a need for accountability and transparency for patients, a likely need for 
reduced societal expectations of medical data privacy as AIs need a large amount of this data to
process and learn from, and a need to mitigate AI biases to avoid worsening healthcare 
disparities for marginalized groups. The legal and regulatory obstacles are also quite extensive
and medical AI literacy needs to be improved and more integrated into education. These issues
will need to be addressed for this technology to reach its potential and achieve widespread use in 
daily clinical practice.
